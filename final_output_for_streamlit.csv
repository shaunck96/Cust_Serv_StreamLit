We own a shopping centre at ****Route ****Coopersburg, PA ****. I spoke to Caroline on 1****, then I spoke to Jody 1**** and your department in three phase. And I also spoke to on 1**** to Jim. There are two metres in dispute. What happens on one meter number? PPL was billing two different tenants for the same meter number. And I do have the account numbers they were billed. OK. Then then we will take the second meter number, the first meter number being billed twice. Two, I mean two two different banners. First standard is being built. Preferred properties. Jeffrey Korkia TORCHIA. He did call last week, by the way, this number. His account number is ****. Dash ****. Because I was asked by the PPL that I must do my due diligence, do the search why it is and where it is. So that's why I'm calling back with the right information. OK. So preferred Realty. Is responsible for meter ********* maybe for last ****years since they've been over Tenet. And somehow. Number same item number. Got billed to golden. Nails spa, Inc. Same letter number on their bill. Their account number **** DASH ****. And the November bill, November 14th Bill, which I took the picture that was for 193.91 just as a reference. So golden nails should not be on that meter. Now the Golden *** golden males. Somebody created the account for us. For the that meter number where golden nails is. I went and spoke to the owners. They said, you know, as long as they get credit for the meter number, PPL has been billing. They have no problem because what we did we we went to, you know, disconnect one at a time to find out who is using that meter, the second meter, which golden nails has been using and they're still using. That meter number is *********. And currently we are the owners AP associate being billed very megabucks and we are looking for a refund and from I think it came on us from June or July, I think June if I'm not mistaken. And that should be billed to golden nails and they should get the credit for. Those months because they were not on the first meter. Preferred Realty, yes. So PPL cannot have a billing to two customers for the same meter number. That's what everybody is. Opinion is, and that's what I was advised by Caroline. Jodi and Jim and I gave you the dates when I spoke to them. And I and I did this due diligence based on their advice. OK, I'm I'm trying to look at the accounts. That makes sense. So first let me let me work with. The. Yeah, let me work with the so the meter number, the first one that you gave me the *********. So in essence what happened was. Golden Nail Spa contacted us in May of ****and connected service at the wrong meter. Plain and simple. It's OK that's not people can make mistakes. Right, right. No, absolutely. So instead of what? So when preferred properties contacted us. From what I can see, this was not mentioned. So it was not mentioned that they that they were forced out by mistake by somebody else connecting there. So we reconnected them as of the next business day. So it wasn't a double bill. We can't bill the customer for the same meter for the same periods of time. But golden nail spas? I'm just looking. Did they contact us and advise them that they were incorrectly billed? Me look at this. Come listen to you very carefully like you listen to me before. Thank. You find so there's just there's so it looks like we did a meter mix investigation and that's I'm just trying to read the comments to understand what happened. Here Umm. There's no need to rush. That's the only way we can resolve it. OK. OK, so yeah, so they say. OK, so the meter number ending in 061 is supposed to be golden nail spa, OK. Yeah that should be 2 nail spa the *******. 61. Right. So what we did was, I think because we were concerned that there would be further confusion, we issued an investigation for one of our representatives to come out to the property, verify who should be connected where. Umm, and it looks like that is with one of our representatives currently. Um, it hasn't been completed yet. We generally have 30 days to complete that investigation, but I believe at this point that is what we are waiting to do. We want to come out and make sure that we have. Every individual at the right meter, so that investigation. Was issued. Sure. I think that so that investigation was issued on December 14th, so we have. About 30 days. Yeah. Yeah. So it should be scheduled to be completed within the next two weeks. No problem. That's not a that's not the issue. You know we we own the shopping center, we are the owners.

We paid because we didn't want to you know, have people because we paid a heavy money, we paid for 30. Your tenant, the dates that they were in that location and then we'll take the corrective action of cancelling the bills, connecting golden nail spas as of when they should have been connected and then crediting APS associates for the time that they were billed, yes.

Christian is talking to us about some accounts that are kind of tangled up in our shopping center. It turns out there\'s a dispute over two different customers billing the same amount of money to the same tenant but for different reasons. The problem seems to be this Instead of billing one common meter number for the first standard standard  they\'re trying to bill two different things for the second. On top of that we\'ve got two different types of water heaters going on at the same time. For example we have a situation with golden nails spa and a spa that\'s been using the very same electric energy distribution system as our salon. Christian explains how he\'s trying to figure out how this all got done. Before he gets to the point however he stops to let us in on a little secret ""I went to visit the nail shop owner and talked to them."" Christian then goes on to explain that you can\'t charge more than one customer for service on the same square metre. That\'s not cheating Christian says; it\'s just a matter of finding the right thing to do. After Christian'"

It was like getting down to it said the cycle was going to be over. When I woke up to the 30th, I woke up to a $431.00 bill that's due January. Whatever. That is completely wrong. It should never be that high. I don't have no water heater leaks. I have nothing. And Umm, yes, maybe Christmas lights were on, but there's no way I use ****kilowatts. Especially my bill. Like I said, when I checked it every day it was at ****I don't know where you are getting $431.79. That's just crazy. OK, so for this I would have to transfer you over to our usage department.

Thank you. So I'm going to transfer you over to our usage department. Thank you for being a valued PPL customer in one moment. Monday. Hello, this is Mary Beth. How can I help you? Hi Mary Beth, this is my name is Kathy Pastor and I am calling because I am very concerned about my bills that I got this month. I check online all the time because a couple months ago I ran into an issue my my electricity was sky high and it had to do with my water heater leaking and now this month. So every month, so every day I check so say like December 29th. I checked it and it said my bill was around. It was going to be like ****It had like maybe a day or two yet to go because I was in a 36 month billing cycle. When I woke up Saturday morning I woke up to a bill of $431.70 and nine cents. There's no way I even checked to make sure my water heater was. Is OK and everything's fine. There's no way it's only two people that live in my household. There's it. I don't know where you got that reading from, but that's definitely incorrect. OK. I can take a look and see. So this month we had we did have some issues on the meters are the bill is an estimate the meters are reading correctly into our meter reading system, our remote meter reading system. But we had some issues with getting readings from the meter reading system over into the billing system. And so most of our customers unfortunately built on an estimate when it estimates it is based on history usually last year at the same time, but I can take a look and see. Umm, if we have the actual reading if the estimate seems. Like that is. Not accurate. Or if it's not. That is not accurate. It is not accurate. It's never. It's only two people that is not accurate at all. Take a look. That is just for two people, that is. Last month my bill was only $115.00. That is. Right, you have electric heat. Do you have electric heat? Though no I have propane. Heat with propane. OK, let me see what the actual reading was on the 29th. So we build you an estimate of ****. Yeah, you're right. That estimate is. Hi the actual reading on the 29th was **** so that is a difference. Of. OK. So the estimate is quite a bit higher. It's about ****It's ****kilowatt hours higher than the actual read, which at our current price per kWh, you're talking over $200.00. So if you'd like, I can get you a corrected bill. Umm, usually the estimate is based on last year at the same time and I'm not sure why it's. Last year I. Had a water heater problem. Last year. OK. So that's why. So I apologize, I'm sure and you know of course it came on a weekend when you couldn't reach us, so you had. To say. About it all. Weekend I'm going to tell you this has completely stressed me out because I'm thinking there is no way with two people. Yes it's Christmas time. Yes, I figured from 1-15 maybe my bill this month would be about 1:50 you know, even 160 I could see because with Christmas lights and your bacon more and you're doing this and that, you know and stuff. But. For. For that. That there is no way. And like I said, I had a water heater problem last year. I don't have that no more. I even had my husband go down to double check it. There's nothing. Nothing. I mean, it's two of us. It's just me and him. We don't have anybody. So it's all completely wrong. So please. Please, please. Because that's just not right. Yeah. So I again, I am sorry. I know that's Umm, I've had that happen myself. When you get a bill that's wrong and it's a weekend and you can't reach people and you're thinking about it, you know, half the weekend I again, I apologize, it was a technical problem. I'll get you the corrected Bill. You should have it in a few days. Umm, that will give you a new date this month. I don't have the exact amount because it has to calculate. Like I said, it's going to be. It looks like a good. 230 or so dollars less than this bill, like significantly. Tell you honey, don't go by the estimate of last year because again that Bill was over like 200 and some dollars I had. But as you as you look at then after that as as time went on, my bill then started becoming normal being like 90 you know like much much cheaper you know for two people you know so I mean because like I said we had a major water heater issue. That we weren't, you know, we just couldn't figure it out. And then we called P&L and you went through it and they're like why don't you check maybe do you have a water heater? And when we went down and we checked it, we actually we rent. So when we called our landlord and he came and looked, I mean it was leaking for months and months and months. That's why our bill because once we ended up getting it fixed in January. Umm, and we went December ****and then in January we got it fit and then February our bill went from it was one ****and then it went down to ****. Yeah, I see. Yeah, the usage dropped by more than half, almost. Yeah, by third. So yeah. Yeah. So you have the actual reading. No, I'm going to use the actual reading. Yeah, OK, yeah. No, I'm. I'm going to use the actual reading. Yeah, OK, I'm going to use the actual reading. OK, OK, I'm going to read the on the actual reading. OK. Thank you. Thank you so much because it, you know it, it completely stressed me out completely. I I understand that I would have felt the same way. And Umm, again, this is we've had. This is the first time I remember I've been here a long time. Umm, like I said, the readings are coming in that just they couldn't get them into the billing system. It was like an IT issue and and they weren't going into billing and rather than hold up everybody's bills while they tried to figure it out, they just. Build everybody on an estimate. And so for people like yourself who had a major change last year, for most people it's OK. But for people like yourself who had a major issue last year, it's a huge problem. So I I understand. So again, my apologies, I'll get that out. You should have that in a few days. You'll get a new due date this month because the due date is always about 20 days after the corrected bills issued. But that's not permanent. You'll go back to your normal bill schedule next month. OK, because I'm even checking like now we are into two or three days into this billing cycle and nothing's even registering yet. So like something is completely. Not, yeah, because right that that that you see online pulls out of the, the, the billing system and so those problems are impacting your ability to see your usage online too. They also corresponded with the cold snap when a lot of people were using, Umm, extra heaters. So we're going to have. People like yourself who are overbilled, and then I think we may also see some. People who? Yeah, because. I know after heat during the cold snap and it doesn't show up, so yeah. Yeah, because I don't use any. We don't. It's like I said, it's only just me and my husband. We have an apartment. It's a smaller apartment. We have propane heat. We don't. You have anything electric, you know that we, you know, we try not to run it. It's just me and him, you know, and that's it, you know, so, and we got all of our electric issues taken care of. So I I would appreciate you helping me. And take in this dramatic change off because. I I appreciate because it completely stressed me out for like 3 days and my husband too, because we just couldn't understand it, you know? So. Yeah, I'm so sorry. So you'll have that corrected Bill in just a few days, even though you can't see your usage online, if you go online, you'll be able to see the corrected bill amount probably by tomorrow. Umm, it'll be in the mail in a few days. OK. Again, I do apologize as my satisfied your concern. Yeah, by taking about $250 off my bill, yeah. Sure, yeah. OK. Thank you. OK. Thank you.

The representative explains that she does not recall ever using kiloatts and that she will be transferring her customer over to the ""usage department"" of the billing division. Before he can help her however she has to verify her name and service address before he can assist her further. She then goes through a lengthy back-and-forth with the man who answers the phone. After natasha explains several of the problems with her bill and asks for an estimate the man finally takes her to the information technology department. There she learns that her bill was last written on December         which is three days before the date on which she calls. Since then she\'s been regularly checking her bill online and in person at the billing office. But when she checks her bill in real life it\'s always been as low as it\'s gotten; there are no signs of any kind of water heater or gas heater leak.

He explains that he has used his visa card to pay for her bill since she just made the payment for him. She makes a note on her account saying that there is money on file waiting to be paid but that it will be  -   business days before it will apply to her account. He then tells her about an on-track pay program that allows people to make automatic payments using their credit card.

Hi Umm, I I received in the mail an estimated still that I know to be incorrect. Umm. And so I'm calling to ask. So I'm I live in central Pennsylvania. But in the beginning of November I closed the house down and moved to Florida to be with my mother. Umm and so. I even had my son drive over to the house to make sure that no one had been living in it and nothing was plugged in. And Umm, so while my bill should probably be as small as it ever was, it's larger than it ever was, based on last year when there were more people living in the house. There's no one in the house now Umm. And I just recently switched to having an auto pay and so on. Pretty terrified that such a large amount will be deducted from my account when I know that it's not right. Can I have the account number please? My, I'm sorry, what the I have. My meter. Number the account number OK **** DASH ****. Thank you. And may I have your name and the address again, please?

Yes. Thank you so much for that information. OK, so Umm there you said you moved from this account. Is this account supposed to be closed? Umm, I'm just away for a few months while I'm in. I'm in Florida with my Umm mother. She is elderly and also went through the hurricane, so I'm down here for a few months. So when before I came down, I unplugged everything and Umm closed the house up for the winter. But I will be moving back. OK, no problem, I understand. I'm so sorry to hear about your Mama as well. But what I can advise is due to a technical issue, our meter data is temporarily unavailable in our customer facing system. As a result, some of our customers received an estimated amount due for bills with a January ****due dates. These estimates are based on actual electricity use data. During this time and billing period last year, we are working to resolve the issue and we we expect that impacted customers. Will receive bills where the actual amounts due next month. We ask that customers pay an estimated bill amount, as any difference will between the estimated bills and actual usage will be reconciled when the next bill is issued. OK, I I I cannot do that. I it's saying that my estimated bill is over $500.00 and and that's more than I have ever paid in my life and I cannot have that automatically deducted from my account. So I would I would like to remove myself from the automated pay. It's just that cannot happen. And and I'll send what I think I owe. And if I underpay, then you can charge me. But I absolutely know that that's wrong and that's way too much money to take out of my checking account. Show some interest on an earlier in automatic bill payments now. Alright, so I'm gonna read you an automatic bill payment and I also placed a temporary temporary hold on the account, so avoid consequences. When that hold is up, your account will be subjected to consequences. I don't know what that means. Play payment charges, collection calls, and possible service termination. I placed the 15 day hold on the account to avoid that. So I don't want, I'm not sure that I probably don't understand. I don't want to end my account. I've I've lived there for more than 20 years. I'm just away temporarily. I'm trying not to have that much money deducted from my checking account. So I, and you may have said this and I don't understand, but I just don't want the autopay, Umm, because I know that that's wrong. That would pay like five months of my bills. And that's crazy. I'm so I'm just asking that I'd be taken off the autopay and I will send money so that I'm not behind on my payment. And that will become apparent when the meter is actually read. No problem.

The company will not reconcile the difference between the two estimates and actual energy use data as it does not have meter data available in its customer-facing system.

I'm sorry, what now? The power is not off. Powers on. But Umm. But the the letter, the letter said at your request would close this account, but. The account that should be closed is the previous one at ****Woodmont Circle in Macungie. OK, so you said the file was ****Was a. Address you were at, correct. The the ****Woodmont Circle is the address we just left, yes. So that's the account that should be closed. It shouldn't be on the under us anymore. Yeah, we. Left there, I don't see an account for the account that I just brought up. You know, we closed that ****at the end of November. OK. Let me say something really quick. Give me a moment. OK. Started. OK. Alright Sir, so here's the service address is. It's very important is, as you say, uh, the ****apologize where you currently live. And that's the service address that we're saying service to. In that account, half closed. For the address. Once the count close, we cannot open it back up. You know that that one wasn't supposed to be closed. We didn't request that one to be closed. That's it. So. Here's the thing, the department that can go in deeper and tell you what happened, what, how it got requested to be turned off and everything like that, that is closed right now. You saying you guys still have power at your ****place, right? Yes, that's correct. Yes. OK, So what I'm going to advise you to do so if the power keep on holding is great.

It's only one time that has happened where somebody needs sorted account, but where they were starting it was a power out. That was a weird night.

His whole life is starting to count for your ****at address like you're a new person. I feel like you're gonna have to do if you have access to your phone, it. Yeah, my suggestion is like try not to do that right now. You can if you want to, but I don't want to start anything where. The borough actually does go off. If your power goes off, find the way to go online starting the account. The date. If you do have to do this, it's not going to give you today's date. You just pick a date and then call in and whoever's on duty, you just tell them you requested power tonight and they'll go forward with it. Still hear your call tomorrow? That's if your power goes out. If your power goes out, then you just make your call tomorrow. Ohkay. Have them explain what happened. Take us through the process and also more formally go through and start your account, because as of right now you don't have an account. Put your parcel law. Alright, so it's a dude. I just want to make sure I understand properly. So do not do not start an online one tonight. Then just wait until tomorrow. Right, all the way you have to start an online account is if your power goes out. It's been cut because the account is off. So you have to start. Yeah. So right now, you know, don't do anything. You guys are good. OK, like I said. Start to process all I call back in and request.

An agent from the agency helps solve the problem explaining that they have just bought a building and recently purchased a new one. They have a ""suite"" in which they pay taxes resolution and their own common areas but it is unclear how bills are being paid. The agency sends someone to make a payment to the account with a checking or credit card; the amount due is included in the bill and there is also a latepayment included. After the agent verifies the name and address of the business bank where the payment is to be made the man begins to tell the woman about the outstanding balance. He explains that he wants to make payments on his personal checking or savings account as well as any business checking or direct deposit to savings accounts. Before he can complete the transaction however she has to be reassured that the payment will go to the correct bank and that no purchase can be made using a card.

OK, the letter of November the 7th said it's supposed to be $64 and I was charged ****. ****OK, So what November? Because of the $7.00 cap charge. That's why the payment was on 71 dollars. Umm in November. And. They did auto reservation for you so when you do a recertification the your amount could change. So your new on track payment is $66 now. OK, but the letter says 64 and it said that it included the $7.00 payment. Said that it included the $7.00 payment. So I'm just trying to understand why you're charging me the 70. $1.00. Just trying to understand why you're charging me with $71.00 and. On November they added the $7.00 charge. That's why you got charged 71. Is that a one time charge? No, it says it's it's only supposed to be $5, not. No, it says it's it's only supposed to be $5, not, not seven. I I don't. Something's not right here. Please. Something's not right here. Please. Give me one second. Now I'm trying to pull up the light of bite. Like I said, you they did auto recertification. Umm. So that's the reason why you know the amount changed also. Because when you, when they, when you do retire vacation. Or or. Your mouth, sometimes they know, will change. Right and the letter in. Front of November the seven dollars was added to the. Bill. In front of me. Hit. OK, again, the letter I received on November 7th said my new payments will be $64. My new team is will be $64. And if you add 64 + 7 it would be 71. But now my next bill came up as ****but now my next bill came up as 66. And when they did the research I had an income change that's I guess that's why they reduced it by $2.00. Not a lot, but it doesn't match. Not a lot, but doesn't match. OK. Yeah, because the payments from May. To November, it was 64. And then now. 66 but I can't pull up the letter. I mean I can provide you with the agencies contact information, you can call your. Local came from PPL. The letter came from PPL. I'm looking right at it. It's on PPL letterhead.

OK, if you have a manager or someone I can speak with please. Do you have a manager? Someone I can speak with? I mean advise you the same information that I'm explaining to you, ma'am. I didn't hear you what? I said they're going to provide you the same information that I'm providing you.

What is their number? What is their number? Is ****Uh. ********OK. And can I speak to a manager there please, because this this is incorrect on this bill. Then if it was $64 + 7 that would make the 71 and so it's I've been overcharged for a couple of months now. So I need to talk with someone who might be able to fix that for me. I I don't think you're able to do so I need to talk to someone who might be able to fix that for me. I I don't think you're able to do something.

The customer complains that the charge is echoing and that her call is taking place in a voice that is clearly echoing. She asks if she can verify the customer\'s identity and address before she begins to delve into her account. After asking many questions she finally gets down to the business of charging the customer over seven dollars when it should only be three. This discrepancy causes the customer to wonder why they are charging him over     dollars when he had only been given a one-time charge of seven dollars. In addition the company charges him a ""cap charge"" of $   .   for the service. When the customer calls back to complain about the excessive charge however she finds out that this was all an error caused by an on-track payment that was made in October but that does not affect her debt situation at all.'"

']",Payment plan options,Online payment,'The narrator explains how he was able to get the address of the company where the bill is being paid by using a drop line. He tells the story of an electric bill that is due in January but has already been paid. The owner of the business Mr. quinion wants to settle the balance with his employees who are employed by Duke University. They send him a bill for three times the actual value of the bill which is why they have to pay such a large sum of money. Mr. Quinion wants to cancel the payment plan and go straight to collection once again. The narrator convinces them that they can do so without having to go through a traditional payment plan.'
13,CA830e9c2351019dbf9f363d37480eeef6,"Good morning. This is chriselle with PPL. How can I help you today? Hello hi this is crystal with PPL. How can I help you today? Yes, I'm calling because I did not receive a new bill for January in the mail. OK, sure I can check it for you. What's your first and last name? Mine is Karen Diaz. The bill is in my husband's name, Ivan Diaz. OK. Thank you. And Karen, what address is this for? 719 N 5th St. OK. And what town is that in? Allentown, PA ****. OK, thank. You and I know that it should have been here quite some time ago. Umm, but I haven't received it. I don't know if it got. Put in someone else's box, but it never ended up back in mind if it went to someone else's box. So the bill, I'm assuming you're talking about the one that was issued December 12th because that would have been due today, the 3rd. So that's the one you didn't get, right. OK, OK. Umm, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't the January 1 because that didn't come out yet, but this one is due for January. So I can, yeah, I can send you a copy, that's not a problem. And we can extend the date as to when it's due. Umm so. That's just gonna, that's just going to be for this month though. I mean the next month will be will be due the same time it was prior. Right. So your bills are normally due in the beginning of the month. So yeah. So today being the third is when your bill is actually due, you didn't get it, so we'll send you a copy and then your new due date would be for the January 24th to give you enough time to get it and pay, make payment. You don't have to wait till then. If you want to pay it right away, you can, OK. But then obviously like a week later, your next bill is going to be due to February 1. Yeah. And then that would be in the first week of the of the month, correct for. February, OK, exactly. So I did go ahead and put in the request to send you the copy. I issued the new due date. Umm. And then did you have more questions on that? Umm, no, except for do I then pay a late fee being? No, because you're not late. Your bills due today. So you're not late at all, Umm, it was due today, but obviously you're calling and saying, hey, I didn't get it. So then we'll go ahead and adjust and Umm, you know, we'll go ahead and document here what happened and yeah, you won't be billed a late payment charger. Yeah, I don't. I don't know. You know, it's a possibility, but the people that live next door to me are no longer there. Actually, there's nobody actually in there. But I do see the mailman go there from time to time with some mail, and I don't know if the envelope got mixed with theirs. And he put it in the door, but I've never received nothing back, so I can't really say what happened to it. Oh, OK, OK, you know. Sometimes they get flustered where stuff is mixed and then the neighbor ends up receiving it instead of you. But sometimes they tend to give me in my mailbox then something that appeared that belonged to me days later a few days later. But I know the bill should have been here back in December already. Maybe the. Third week of September is when the third week of the month is when we usually receive the bills and I've never seen it and I was keeping an eye out. Keeping an eye out never got it, so I can't say really where it went, but I never received it. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I mean it. Hurts because it usually comes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it could have been, you know. A mix up with the, you know, holiday mail and so on. Umm, if there was a lot of mail, Umm, you know, it could have been anything, unfortunately. But Umm, we, like I said, I I went ahead, Umm issued your copy. You'll get the new due date and then that's documented here on your account. And then, Karen, the other thing I did want to mention before we hung up here, Umm. PPL, our job is to deliver power safely and reliably to your home or business. But we don't own the power plants for that. Electricity is generated in Pennsylvania. You can choose the power. Supplier that provides your electricity without impacting the quality of service we provide. We have a program called the standard offer program. Now through that program you can you may be able to save some money by enrolling with an electric generation supplier. Did you want to hear more about that? Umm, not at the moment, but maybe in the future, yes. OK, not a problem, not a problem at. All it is, it is very important. But yeah, maybe in the near future I would probably call back and discuss it with someone, but not at the. Moment. OK, that's fine. Alright then, you're all set Karen. Umm, I just wanted to ask if I satisfied your concerns. Uh, yes, I was wondering, Umm, is there a total that you can give me at the moment on what the bill was? Oh yeah, your balance total right now is ****Oh. ****. OK, then I'll Umm, expect to see the copy hopefully. Yep. Yeah. And if not, I will contact back again regarding the situation, but most likely I should see it. Hopefully within the week today. Not at the holidays are done, yeah. Yeah, exactly.

14,CA9773a872462b8f5316b42d2a47fa313c,"Hello. My name is Tamika. May I have your first and last name please? Sure. It's Diane and my last name is Jago Jago. Thank you and how may I help you today? I'm trying to make my payment online with that pay with the the auto payment thing they said but we're we already called and asked earlier we we have a the utility support card where you can you get $100 for utilities of your choice whatever gas electric or whatever. And we wanted to use it to pay the electric bill. Now the problem is when I put the numbers in uh it, it doesn't take the last number of the card. Am I hitting on the wrong card when they say what card is it? It's not a visa. Or bank card, so I don't know what kind of card this is. I don't know the right option hit. Logo on it. No. No, but it said you could. Pay the MasterCard logo on it. No, and they're aware of it. No, it has. All the logo it has is a. It's for it says it's from Highmark Healthcare. Umm, utility support and you get $100 a month. On here to pay towards utility so it just has a box on here and says S3. That's all it says. Because you. Got you. Might want to call the card company. Ma'am, I'm sorry that you're having a problem because the only thing that I'm in a position to do is transfer you back to try and make an effort again with that card payment line because we're not able to process payment, but if the system is not recognizing that card or has a problem with. That you have the saying it isn't. I'm not saying it. Isn't, it is. I didn't put it through yet because when I put the numbers in I do the first which, but there's three options. One is for a visa, MasterCard or whatever. The second one. I don't know what that one was for. And then the last one says commercial something. So what which one do I hit for this card? That's all I need to know. Because the lady knew what I was talking. About whatever it tells you, it's that. Yeah, yeah. If you have if you have a visa logo on it, you want to hit visa. If it's a master logo, then you hit Visa MasterCard. And if it don't, don't. Why? But I've never heard it to ask that information. I thought it just. I thought you just enter your card number. Is it? You just need your card. Number, that's what I thought. And it goes to that option. You have never heard of it accident an option for what type of card is it? So and and it puts them all in but the last number. So do you think I should still click that it's OK that that's the number and then see if it goes through or? Yes, ma'am. You can't because you don't card payments. You don't have anything to do with card payments. You have to transfer you to the system to process the card payments, yeah. All right. Well, I'm just going to call back this number again and and try to do it again. Because she said you could do it with the card. So. Yes, ma'am, I sincerely apologize, but yeah you I mean it normally just I have you to enter the card number in and your code and expiration date. That's why I did but when. Right. And it's not and that that's what I'm wondering because what I I didn't go to hit accept it because it don't register that last number, but I'm wondering if it will. If I hit. When you said that last number, are you referring to the Security Code number? No, no, the card number. Like I could put all the numbers. In. And the last the last five numbers it only takes 4 of it. So I'm going to try it again and just do that and see what happens if it says security. 16 numbers on that card. I believe most card has what 16 numbers on. It yeah, this one has 17. 4. Ohh yeah see most cards only have 16 numbers, so I'm not sure why. That may be the reason why the system is just too many numbers. This one has 6 numbers. This one has two extra numbers, but it takes it up to the four. And it's all the way. **** I mean 5 numbers. So it takes the four but not the last one. So it has over 16 numbers on that card, ma'am, altogether. There's 17 numbers. Yeah, that's the problem. It's too many. It's too many numbers on that card. I would highly suggest you call the card company, because apparently that system is not it's not, it's not putting it in because of too many numbers. Yeah. That's why I was wondering what to do. What I can do is I can give you the number to clementis. Umm, yeah, I'll give you the number to supplement this customer service. Umm, to see if they have any update in reference to that? Why the system is not recognizing that number? Umm, I there's too many numbers for one because most card numbers only should. But the thing of it is I never never accepted it to see if it does. I just did it didn't it didn't read back. All the numbers, but you said it won't. The other words it read all the numbers back to me but that last one. So I got out of it. Yes, yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I understand what you were saying. As I was stating, it's just too many numbers. That's why it's not giving that last number. It's only giving you 16 numbers as it would recognize it's only 16 numbers, right. So I'm going to give you the number 2 paymentus customer service and they can better assist you with more enzas as of to why. You can explain to them, you have a card, a card. My biggest concern is they don't have a visa or MasterCard logo on it and you have 17 numbers. My, my. Question to permenter. Alright, so the number 2 paymentus customer service is one ************OK, and this they'll help me with this card. And you just want to explain to them that you are trying, they're not going to be able to process the payment, but they can probably give you an answer more and. Maybe. You don't need to them that you have a card that has 17 numbers. Go ahead. The lady told me that I spoke to earlier, said she goes all you do is go through the options and you uh put in other amount because she told me how to do it. To put the amount in. And then she said once you get to the payment part, it should come up where you can just put your card numbers in and then hit accept. But I didn't hit accept. It's what I'm trying to say to you. Miss Diane, I understand that, but when I'm trying to get you to understand is that you have too many numbers on that card. It should also I'm wondering will it recognize what I'm? Explaining to me that you have 17 numbers. Yeah, it's not recognizing that last number because it's too many numbers as, as I was mentioning earlier, it should only be 16 numbers, not 17. So that's why it's not giving you that last number because there's too many numbers. Those were stumped that I don't know what to do. I've got a call. This number, you call that card number and explain to them that you're trying to make your payment. Yeah, call that. You can call customer premises, customer service number, I'll give you their number, but you want to call that card company as well and let them know that our system is only recognized in 16 numbers, not 17. Because the average cards credit cards. Umm, on most cars there's only 16 and it it requires you have a visa or MasterCard logo on, and if you don't have any of that on that card, then it's apparently not a card that's usable for our system. Let me get that number again. OK, alright. So customer service number is one ****************Yeah, I'll call them now. Yes, ma'am. So just explain what's going on and Umm, I'm questioning probably explain the same issues, too many numbers. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am. So it's alright. Alright, thank you.

I'm trying to make my payment online with that pay with the the auto payment thing they said but we're we already called and asked earlier we we have a the utility support card where you can you get $100 for utilities of your choice whatever gas electric or whatever. And we wanted to use it to pay the electric bill. Now the problem is when I put the numbers in uh it, it doesn't take the last number of the card. Am I hitting on the wrong card when they say what card is it? It's not a visa. "", "" Or bank card, so I don't know what kind of card this is. I don't know the right option hit. Logo on it. No. No, but it said you could. "", "" Pay the MasterCard logo on it. No, and they're aware of it. No, it has. "", "" All the logo it has is a. It's for it says it's from Highmark Healthcare. Umm, utility support and you get $100 a month. On here to pay towards utility so it just has a box on here and says S3. That's all it says. Because you. Got you. Might want to call the card company. "", "" Ma'am, I'm sorry that you're having a problem because the only thing that I'm in a position to do is transfer you back to try and make an effort again with that card payment line because we're not able to process payment, but if the system is not recognizing that card or has a problem with. That you have the saying it isn't. I'm not saying it. "", "" Isn't, it is. I didn't put it through yet because when I put the numbers in I do the first which, but there's three options. One is for a visa, MasterCard or whatever. The second one. I don't know what that one was for. And then the last one says commercial something. "", "" So what which one do I hit for this card? That's all I need to know. Because the lady knew what I was talking. About whatever it tells you, it's that. "", "" Yeah, yeah. If you have if you have a visa logo on it, you want to hit visa. If it's a master logo, then you hit Visa MasterCard. And if it don't, don't. Why? But I've never heard it to ask that information. I thought it just. I thought you just enter your card number. "", "" Is it? You just need your card. Number, that's what I thought. And it goes to that option. You have never heard of it accident an option for what type of card is it? So and and it puts them all in but the last number. "", "" So do you think I should still click that it's OK that that's the number and then see if it goes through or? Yes, ma'am. You can't because you don't card payments. You don't have anything to do with card payments. You have to transfer you to the system to process the card payments, yeah. "", "" All right. Well, I'm just going to call back this number again and and try to do it again. Because she said you could do it with the card. "", "" So. Yes, ma'am, I sincerely apologize, but yeah you I mean it normally just I have you to enter the card number in and your code and expiration date. That's why I did but when. Right. And it's not and that that's what I'm wondering because what I I didn't go to hit accept it because it don't register that last number, but I'm wondering if it will. "", ' If I hit. When you said that last number, are you referring to the Security Code number? No, no, the card number. Like I could put all the numbers. ', "" In. And the last the last five numbers it only takes 4 of it. So I'm going to try it again and just do that and see what happens if it says security. 16 numbers on that card. I believe most card has what 16 numbers on. It yeah, this one has 17. "", "" 4. Ohh yeah see most cards only have 16 numbers, so I'm not sure why. That may be the reason why the system is just too many numbers. This one has 6 numbers. This one has two extra numbers, but it takes it up to the four. "", "" And it's all the way. **** I mean 5 numbers. So it takes the four but not the last one. So it has over 16 numbers on that card, ma'am, altogether. There's 17 numbers. "", "" Yeah, that's the problem. It's too many. It's too many numbers on that card. "", "" I would highly suggest you call the card company, because apparently that system is not it's not, it's not putting it in because of too many numbers. Yeah. That's why I was wondering what to do. What I can do is I can give you the number to clementis. Umm, yeah, I'll give you the number to supplement this customer service. "", "" Umm, to see if they have any update in reference to that? Why the system is not recognizing that number? Umm, I there's too many numbers for one because most card numbers only should. But the thing of it is I never never accepted it to see if it does. I just did it didn't it didn't read back. All the numbers, but you said it won't. The other words it read all the numbers back to me but that last one. So I got out of it. Yes, yes, ma'am. "", "" Yes, ma'am. I understand what you were saying. As I was stating, it's just too many numbers. That's why it's not giving that last number. "", "" It's only giving you 16 numbers as it would recognize it's only 16 numbers, right. So I'm going to give you the number 2 paymentus customer service and they can better assist you with more enzas as of to why. You can explain to them, you have a card, a card. "", "" My biggest concern is they don't have a visa or MasterCard logo on it and you have 17 numbers. My, my. Question to permenter. Alright, so the number 2 paymentus customer service is one ************OK, and this they'll help me with this card. And you just want to explain to them that you are trying, they're not going to be able to process the payment, but they can probably give you an answer more and. "", "" Maybe. You don't need to them that you have a card that has 17 numbers. Go ahead. The lady told me that I spoke to earlier, said she goes all you do is go through the options and you uh put in other amount because she told me how to do it. To put the amount in. And then she said once you get to the payment part, it should come up where you can just put your card numbers in and then hit accept. But I didn't hit accept. "", "" It's what I'm trying to say to you. Miss Diane, I understand that, but when I'm trying to get you to understand is that you have too many numbers on that card. It should also I'm wondering will it recognize what I'm? Explaining to me that you have 17 numbers. Yeah, it's not recognizing that last number because it's too many numbers as, as I was mentioning earlier, it should only be 16 numbers, not 17. "", "" So that's why it's not giving you that last number because there's too many numbers. Those were stumped that I don't know what to do. I've got a call. This number, you call that card number and explain to them that you're trying to make your payment. "", "" Yeah, call that. You can call customer premises, customer service number, I'll give you their number, but you want to call that card company as well and let them know that our system is only recognized in 16 numbers, not 17. Because the average cards credit cards. "", "" Umm, on most cars there's only 16 and it it requires you have a visa or MasterCard logo on, and if you don't have any of that on that card, then it's apparently not a card that's usable for our system. Let me get that number again. OK, alright. So customer service number is one ****************Yeah, I'll call them now. Yes, ma'am. "", "" So just explain what's going on and Umm, I'm questioning probably explain the same issues, too many numbers. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am. So it's alright.

The system does not accept the card she is trying to use because it does not have the correct number of its card. She uses an alternate method to pay and hits a series of boxes that tell her what kinds of cards she is dealing with. Her problem is that when she inputs the card numbers into the system she ends up hitting three options visa bank commercial and utility support. None of them give her the right card number. Finally she hits a card called ""vex logo"" which says utility support but does not provide any other options. It takes her to a page telling her what the card is and where to find more information about it. After some more confusion she finally lands on the issue of how to best deal with this strange card. A woman named tamika who also goes by the name of Dali diane explains to the newbie that in addition to being unable to process payments using conventional methods such as auto-pay they can also be slow or take several tries before reaching a final decision.

I'm doing OK Umm, this is PR, right? Yes. OK, Umm, I have a I have a question about my current statement and judging by the length of the hold, everybody's been calling today. So I don't know if you've been through this 100 times today or not, but. I'm going to walk you through it. Can I give you my account number, please? Actually, the only thing I would need here is your address. 109 Pleasant view drive. Strasburg, PA ****. Alrighty, thank you so much for that. And I do have your account fully pulled up. OK. So I I'm looking at my my my November bill in comparison to my December bill and I'm. Basically, the reason why I'm calling is my. December bill is. Two times more than my November bill was. And I am trying to figure out what the reason for that is. I can see the supply charge. Is significantly more. For my December bill, and I'm wondering why that is did. Did something end and I I need to sign up for something or what? What's going on here? OK. So I'll definitely be more than happy to assist. So on the the most recent statement that you received here of the $403.93, that is an estimated billing statement. The reason why you received an estimated billing statement is due to a technical system issue with the meter data is temporarily unavailable in our systems. So as a result of that technical issues, some of our customers receive estimated billing amounts that's due for January and those estates. From estimates were based on actual electricity use data during the same billing period from last year. We are working to resolve the issue and we expect that impacted customers will receive deals with their actual amounts due next month. So the current balance here that is being billed and we do accept the customers to make those payments and any difference between the estimated billing statements and your actual usage will be reconciled when we issue out that next bill. Where on this does it tell me it's an estimate? Like all it does say estimated Bill right there in the middle? So, yes, Sir. So if. Why uh, much special. I know this. Why can't I pay $250 instead of $400.00 which is more than what my N1 was it, which includes all my Christmas lights I had up. And then if that doesn't cover it, then can you roll whatever else I owe into the the February bill? I, like you guys, doubled my my charge at that doesn't necessarily make sense to me that. I should have to. Pay two times. More. Now we do have an option for you, Umm, which you know it's, I'm not sure if you're at the home right now where you are. If you are able to provide us with, OK well we do have the option where if you can go out to your meter and provide us the meter, the information is reading off of your meter. We can actually, yeah, the reading, we can submit it over to our back office so that that we can rebuild the. On usage. OK. What? Umm, I was trying to call Umm several times before and you guys were closed I guess because the holiday is what, what is the latest I can call this evening? What's that meter reading? Number. Will be six. Oh well, no. The billing department closes at 5. OK, so I mean I work an hour from my house and I don't get home until I don't get off till five. So if I check that reading tonight, can I call back tomorrow with this information? Yeah, call back in first thing in the morning. And what I'll do is I'll go ahead and notate your account so that any representative who you do speak with in the morning, they'll be already to kind of know exactly what you're doing on what you're wanting. And you just call in and provide them with your meter reading and they'll put it into the system and send it over to the appropriate department so that we can rebuild the account on actual usage. So I'm I'm just thinking this through. I'm trying to. I'm trying to figure out where. That's gotta be the one right outside my side door, because that's where our there would be, right by the, uh, the breaker box, typically, right? Correct, exactly. Well, it'll be out on outside portion right there by the box here either. OK. So I wasn't sure if that was a water meter or but now that I'm thinking about that's great where my breaker box is. So yeah, I can do that and I'll so I so I just call again like I did this like I did right now and Umm, hopefully it'll be earlier in the morning and the wait won't be as long. What time is the accounting office open? Um, we open up at 7. At 8:00 or 7:00, so I can call on my way to work maybe that streamline this whole process. OK. Well, I really appreciate your time. You helped me out a lot. Thank you very much. Definitely not a problem, Matthew. And so just to summarize our conversation, we discussed the reason why you received an estimated bill and we needed to estimate your energy usage so that we could send you out a billing statement. I am going to go ahead and document that you will be gathering out your actual readings off of your meter and reaching back out to us tomorrow so that we can rebuild the account on actual usage and have us satisfied all concerns today.

""]",Meter Readings,Budget billing,'Jasmine a customer of St. Paxton power company calls to complain about her electric bill. She is upset that her December bill is twice the amount of her November bill and she wonders why she has to pay twice as much. The utility company explains in an email that its customers are being charged more because of a technical problem with the monitoring of their electric meters. Customers who have not yet paid their bills will be given an option to pay less than what they owe due to an error in the calculation of the actual usage during the billing period last year. However most customers will be hit with higher late-January bills since the utility does not have the means to monitor and correct such imbalances. If your bill is late you should contact your local supervisor.'
17,CA4c9e6b30b1cb01495a29d7d25550540f,"Hi, thanks for calling PPL. My name is chassidy. How may I help you today? Good morning Cassidy. My name is William W Offenders and I'm calling in reference to the few things. First thing is that this web, your website hasn't been working since December. Is there a reason for that? Got any? I'm not sure of any error issues or I'm sorry, any issues with the online account? Umm, if you do need assistance with online account, I can transfer your call to our department for further assistance. Well, that's one thing, but the other thing is. Uh, my. I know I have a bill that's supposed to be overdue, but I I took care of that. I changed my account and my checking account number. In a different kind of billing cycle. And uh, just so you wanna double check with if you could double check it to make sure we're still on the same page. Here I got a letter in the mail from them. So they did because they have automatic payment. OK, let me take a look at the account. Can you confirm the service address please? ****Jager YERGER Rd. in London, PA. The zip is ****. OK. And can you also confirm the phone number on file please, ************? Perfect. Thank you very much for confirming that information for me today. OK. So I do see December 19th, you did call in to up. See your payment information to new information. Uh. But when you did call in on December 19th, your bill had already generated for the current bill of 211 and 67 cents. That was due as of December 29th and with you updating your. Autopay during this billing cycle. Umm, it would not be. Chronically withdrawn right by the due date because it was updated during the billing cycle. Umm. I do see that you were advised that the and updating it that Autopay would withdraw both payments starting with your next bill next month that you were advised that by the representative did speak to that's correct. The reason I'm asking the questions keep it keeps on saying is with it's overdue and overdue you know and then when you see this on their on their system you think their system is. Have the right information on it. Stating that things are being moved, different accounts and things. She seems odd to me that in this account there's these numbers. This just don't make sense to me on their on their website. It's very hard to deal with right now. I sent emails out the numerous times. No response. It just don't have no information on our stuff. What now? Does this says the bills over there, which regards. Yeah, but why would it? Why would it say that? Bills overdue and so they'll charge a fee? So because the bill is overdue, because the 267 cents was due at #29, the bill is considered past due, but there is a suspended charge on the account. So this account is protected because we are aware that next month auto pay will be withdrawing both payments by the due date to your account is protected. Right. Yeah. So your account is protected, it's just not going to reflect the suspend charge on the online account because that is just to reflect either build their own code to make a payment and things of that nature, but on. Yeah, but we speak, it's presented, we can see that the account is protected because of this suspend charge. OK, thank you that. And that's good. You know, I wanted to verify because I got the letter, but every time I look at this and of course my all my information, all my usage is not even up to date. Everything is sort of stagnated up here. I don't know what that would be. I can't figure. I never had a problem I understand completely. It's just, uh, it's sort of odd to me if you. I've had I've been doing everything online for eternity and all of a sudden since the 19th of January or just give me 19th December, everything went crazy. Nothing comes up to date and they haven't been getting a meter readings or nothing on this thing. Your online account is not reflecting any recent reading. Reflected anything. It's just, it's it's just, it's a it's a real mess, OK? OK, give me one second to see if there's any information I can see. Bear with me a moment. OK, sure. Apologize for all this, but this is the sort of. Because I do everything ****everything online and voice been annoying. Oh no, that's OK. Yeah, no, I understand completely and you want to make sure everything is I understand, right? I can give that way. Keep an idea when you're retired, you wanna keep a good close to what your usage is. Right. No, I understand. No. Your online account is not reflecting any current meter readings or what your usage is currently correct. Matter of fact, even on the spreadsheet you want to make sure nothing's working. OK. And I and I do know that. There have been issues with the certain things, so that's typical for websites to happen. Right. No, of course. You know, sometimes the computer has a mind of its own. We really, we really want to go there. It's worse than that, yeah. Yeah, the Internet. Anything with the online? Has a mind its own sometimes. Well, and it does. And the problem is trying to get a hold of anyone. It's really complicated today. And uh, I would have I I'm, I'm, I'm glad I'm tech savvy because these something about 80% of the people, older people I know, maybe 90% of them, they have no idea what's how the how. They even mix abstraction. That's why it's really sad. Right now. No, yeah, of course. Right. That's everywhere. You go to a store. Computers are down. If people in store don't even how to make change, they don't even have what to do. It's sad. No, yeah, I. Understand. So while I get some additional information, so I'm just gonna place you on a brief, OK, certainly. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Please hold. Alrighty, William, thank you so much for holding. So I'm not sure if that may be a online issue with you not being able to see, like your current usage. So what I wanted to do is transfer your call to speak to a representative who would be able to further assist you. It would be our energy education department only because you are not seeing energy usage instead of it being our Web department. OK. OK. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Yeah, of course, you're very welcome. And before your call, just to recap what we did discuss, uh, we did advise that with you updating auto pay during the billing cycle, it was speaking with the previous representative that both starting with your next bill and the and the auto pay will be updated and all your concerns satisfied before transaction. Paul, you you did, you did everything that was on the computer there. You read all the notes and just verify that. We're on the same page. Well, thank you so much. You're very welcome and thank you for being a valuable PPL customer and please hold while I transfer your call. Thank you. You're welcome. Good morning. This is Laura. How may I help you? Uh, yes.

Unfortunately we're having some problems internal here. PPL to get the the data to show, Sir. To our customers, could you give me an idea of what I'm trying to keep? Get some idea where what my usage is right now and there's nothing? Even on the Excel spreadsheet there's nothing listed. That's the reason I'm asking the question correct because we're having problems showing it. So you won't see it until we correct the situation, which we are trying desperately to correct, Sir. Yeah, I don't know. I just curious wonder what might have happened. It's an internal problem to PPL Sir. Ohh really internal. Is there a way you will be looking for a couple of days we got it back and then it's it went again. So our IT team is working on it, right? Could it, could you tell me what my usage is right now? Unfortunately, I don't see that Sir. We only have a limited number of people who do see it. Ohh, really. Ohh boy, your name is. Yeah, I just wish I could figure what the usage was, but. Trying to understand what what the high lows were on this, but there's no way, we no way to check at all, is there? What I see is what you see, Sir. I apologize greatly. That's all I have access to. So how's this gonna react to the billing on this? The readings are there, we just can't put them out for some reason we can't we're just not able to to show them. We have all the reasons just want to affect this won't affect the meter date, the billing date, right. OK OK. So it's an internal problem. So OK that's when the verify that and see what's going on. Well thank you so much. Your bill normally comes out at the end of the. Like the first week or so, so hopefully we'll have a corrected so you could see it before it comes out. But your name is Sir.

The representative confirms the address and phone number and adds that when he last checked with the company it had been six months since he made the changes.

The bill is a duplicate of the one he sent out last week but since he sent it out in the mail it\'s too late the owner of the bill issued a new bill instead. Since they have an email account  they accept it over their domain name . The problem is that the new bill won\'t allow them to take back their passwords and will require a new pass password. They\'re trying to hold up the assistance for three weeks. The woman knows exactly what kind of problems this is having and she calls back to help. Her name is Katherine and after some back-and-forth she manages to figure out that the problem is related to a bill signed by a person using their email address rather than their passwords.

20,CAa615e4a7b25b40a7e74e55cb45ba0716,"Thank you for calling PPL. This is Lauren. How can I help you? Hi, Umm. I currently rent and. We are moving. So I I need my electricity that I have now like transferred to a new place. And I know I probably I could have done that online, Umm a lot easier. But my landlord now that where I currently live. He wants the electric put back in his name so that it doesn't go out. And I wasn't sure how to how I could do that online, so that's why I just called. That is not actually something that you would be able to do actually on your own. Umm, he would either have to have it set up on a landlord agreement for it to automatically go back, or he would have to call in and start. I can tell you once we try to stop the service in your name if that actually is the case. OK. Umm, because the where we are moving right now? Is she? She has it set up to where the power over there is going to be shut off at 10:00 AM tomorrow. So we just, me and my husband just wanted, you know, to put it in our name so that way it wouldn't. Sarah sure. No, currently in the process of moving, so we are, we are staying in the House. Where we're paying now. But like I said, I don't want the power to go off over there, so my landlord now said. Umm, just to put the power back in his name so that the power would stay on here while we're in the process of moving? Alright, what do I? Do can I just transfer our account over to the new place and then just have him call? Right. Well, that's what I'll yes, that's what I'll take a look at to see what's going on. It may automatically go back in his name on the day that you stopped the service in your name. Umm, I won't know that until I try to do it though. OK. Alright, So what is the address that you are moving from? Umm 64 tierzoo Rd. And the name on the account. Uh, David Kilmer, my husband. Is David there with you? Umm, he actually just pulled up. Would you need to speak to him? Yeah, I would at least need permission since his name is on the account. Umm for you to continue to put it in his name at the new location and stop it at the old one. OK, let me just grab them real quick, just walking in right now. Thank you. Perfect timing. She needs your permission because it's your name on the account for me to go through with it. Hello. Hi, who am I speaking with please? Uh, Dave kilmer? Hi David. Umm, do I have permission for your spouse to continue stopping service in your name and then starting it at the new location for you? Yes you do. All right. Thank you so much for that. Yep. Thank you. Hello. Alright, I'm sorry. Thank you. I appreciate that. No problem. Alright. And then the phone number on the account? Umm, I think you. I'm not sure if it's ***********. That is one of them on there. Yep, OK. Alright. And then I'm sorry, your first name was again, I apologize. Megan. Megan, thank you. All right, Megan. So we're going to transfer the service. Let's see what we have going on. Now your new service, what's the address that you would like to start that at? Umm 86 Meadow Lane. In Clifford Township. All right, 86 Meadow Lane, Clifford Township, ****. Umm, yeah. Perfect. And then the final bill for the 64 Tierzoo Rd. should that go to the new address? Yeah. All right. And then at 64, you are not the landlord and we want to stop that service on what day? Umm, she said. The power over there will be shut off tomorrow by 10:00 AM. So that's at the new location, correct? Yeah, yeah. Where did you want us when you stopped the service at the tiers or Rd. location? What day did you want to do that? Umm. Probably tomorrow also. OK, now it doesn't look like there's a landlord agreement set up at that location, so the landlord of 64 tiers or Rd. would actually need to call us to start the service back up in his or her name. OK. All right. Now, did you still want to do that tomorrow morning? Because that would actually be the same time as well, right around 10:00 AM. Umm. Yeah, because I'll just have him call today or. Yeah, I can have him call today. That way it's turned back on, you know, for tomorrow morning. OK, continue. Perfect. Alright, so we're stopping that one on the 4th. And then we're going to start your service also on the 4th. All right, so 86 Meadow Lane in Clifford Township, that is a residence, correct? That's not a business. No, that's your residence, yeah. Alright. And we're doing that tomorrow morning. And do you own the home or are you renting? You're renting. You said that was the landlord, right? Yep. Sorry. Yeah. And that'll be a primary residence for you. Yeah. And do you know, does that new location have electric heat? Umm, yeah. No, no, it's oil heat. And mailing address will be the same 86 Meadow Lane. Yeah. Alright, uh, and then an e-mail address. I show 1 from your current account. Can you verify what that is for me? Umm, is it the David Lee killmer? It is. Yes, OK. I wasn't sure because sometimes I put my stuff on his because he he makes me do all the. The. Bills. Yes, I know. Yeah, they all do. For some reason they don't like to be on the phone. No. Ohh OK alright so so far what I have done is we are going to stop the service and start the service all on the same day on the 4th. Uh we're stopping at 64 Tierzoo road and we're starting at 86 Meadow Lane tomorrow morning, January 4th. OK. Alright. And then we're just going to set up some account preferences for your new account and then you will be all set today. OK. I also PPL electric utilities customer.

Alright. And then how would you prefer those to come through? Would you prefer an e-mail, a text message or a telephone call? Umm, a text message is good. All right.

If there's a power outage at your location, you're going to receive periodic updates about when we feel that that would be restored. Now that's the one that can come through anytime, day or night.

Alright, and we did link this to the account, I'm sorry to the e-mail address that we had on file so that if you did want to access your account online, you can always do that. OK. Umm, and we have a new account number for you. Not unusual. We always we create a new account number even when we're transferring service. Umm, you probably already got it through e-mail, but did you want to take it down today? Umm yeah, let me grab a pen just in. Case alright, thank you. Alright, I'm ready. That number is ****41. OK. What was that 41? Correct, yes. And then ****01. OK. Alright. And then did you have any questions for me today on that transfer of service? Umm. So now when I tell my my current landlord. Umm. Because he's 99, so I just want to make sure. He understands. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's up there. So I want to make sure. So all he has to do is call and just tell them, tell you guys. You know, just by tomorrow, he wants the electric transferred back into his name then. Correct. Yeah. Does he need like an account number or anything? No, no, because we'll change that every time. Even as a landlord, he would constantly get a new account number anytime anybody moved in or. Out. Umm. We just always have to talk to the person that's going to be responsible for the bill. Umm, but we'll take care of all that. We'll walk him through everything, uh, once he does call. OK. All right. And then I do just have one more thing that I am required to let you know about, uh.

She doesn\'t know how to do this online though and can\'t figure out a way to make it happen by herself. Her dilemma is that she and her husband are moving with all of their belongings to an apartment where they will be shutting off the power on the morning of the next day. The landlord wants to put his name back in hers in order to have the electric stay on while they are in the ""process of moving"" . Can she just transfer her account from one place to another and then have the landlord call in once she has moved? In addition she asks if she can continue to use David kilm\'s name on her account as she moves to the other location. The answer is yes but she will need to get permission from her husband David which she gets when she tells him that she plans to continue using his name to pay for the electricity at both places. After getting permission she instructs David to tell his wife that he will continue using her name to fund the new house until the end of service in the old location.

But unfortunately I'm seeing that you got a new date extension and the payment is due today. I'm sorry. OK. OK. Umm, so I'm seeing now we have a building on the account for the $253.11. Is that the amount that you wanted to pay today? No, I'm I made an arrangement to pay the ****. Today. Let me see. Let me just double check. Oh, so it defaulted. OK. So I'm seeing that you had a collection, what we call a collection arrangement to pay **** by the 21st of December. Yeah, I had. Called, but it has defaulted. Yeah, well, I had called and they asked for an extension and they told me I had it for today. Yeah, so they give you a date extension, but it would have been for the full bill, not just the amount that was due at the time. Umm. So unfortunately the collection arrangement on the account has defaulted, so you can't pay the **** alone. You would need to pay the full balance. But it's OK. I still do have the option here to set you up on another collection arrangement to pay the **** by the 2nd of February and up to three installments that way as well. We can have you make a payment on the 6th of January, seeing as that was initially what you wanted. OK, now what is it? Can you tell me again? I didn't understand. That research so we can pay the $****Sorry to be quite honest I think I got a bit excited. So we have a bill on the account for 253 eleven that OK you said was you on East 3rd of January was the ****. OK. However, that **** it was on a collection arrangement, so that payment would have had to be made by the 22nd, 21st because that payment was missed because. Thought you could pay it by the third city, it was defaulted. So we do still have the option to have you set up on a different collection arrangement to pay the two ****and up to three installments by the 4th of 14. Sorry of February. That way you can make a payment by the 6th of January. OK, now how much do I have to pay? OK, so. Well, we can break it up into three installments or you compare the 163 or one by the six of January and then the remaining balance is $90.10 on any day between now and the 14th of February. OK, well, is there? I could just break it up. See, what happened was that's why I asked for an extension. What happened was my husband's Social Security check was stopped and and that's why I asked for the extension because there was no funds. And Umm. And that's why she said, you know, I'll give you to the third. Umm. But if I could pay like I don't know how. Like you said to pay how much on the 6th of January? Well, you can make any payments. Remember it's would be in three installments. You can make any payments of the any amount that you want so long as it makes up the **** by the 14th of February if you would like as well, we do have the option to set you up on a payment plan which will determine the minimum amount that would be needed to protect the service and then the remaining balance will be paid in installments plus your monthly bill. If we do go to any payments on route, the collection arrangement would no longer be available, so would you be interested in the payment plan instead? OK. How much would that be? Right, that's so with the payment plan, we would, I would have to advise you that if we do, because I would have to take your information, if we do go down your payment plan route, we would not have the option to get you only three installments again, OK. OK. Now if I do 3 installments now you said to or add up to ****right? Is that is that what you mean? By February. The 14th. ****Correct. Well, can I do the three? The three? Umm. You know the three installments. Instead installments. Yeah, sure, no problem. Umm. So Umm, your payment of can be made in up to three installments. So how many installments would you like to use to pay your balance of $253.11? OK. Well would that be, would that be three, I don't know. How? How does that work? But we can do it in three. Or you can. Or if you would like, I can push the full amount of $253.11 to the 14th of February and then you can just bring it up in installments yourself. OK. Well, can I just pay the full balance on the the 14th of February? Like the ****I think. Umm, by then. Umm see, my husband's trying to get see. He should get reinstated. But The thing is, he's. He's hoping he'll get something, so hopefully by February I'll be off. Hopefully by settled. Umm. So can we do the? Can I pay the full **** on the 14th of February? Or will we get a shut off? Sure. So I'll push it back to the 14th of Sudbury. So I will push you back ****to February. This would prevent from any collection activity, but I would have to advise you that any bill that's generated between now and then would need to be paid by the due date, OK. OK. So February 14th, 23, and it'll be how much, ****11. 11. Names are once again an e-mail that's generated, so it will be your January bill. Once it is generated, it would need to be paid by the due dates, OK? OK. So I could pay. The anything else you'd like me to do for you while I still have you on you? Yeah. So thank you. ****on the 14th of February. And what it? What is your name again? Sorry, it's Danielle. What is it? What? What is your? Name. Sorry, it's Danielle. Danielle.

It turns out that the account had defaulted on its collection arrangement and that the payment was due today only.

He also explains how the agency calculates the amount of the difference between the two bills due to the fact that he does not yet have a bill in on track yet. Finally he tells ratata that because of the complexity of calculating the amount it takes into account any bills that show up later in the month that are smaller than the ""on track"" amount Ratata is calling about.

OK, let's forget for that we'll come down to where? You are you. You have a 500 and. So they build, they already have this, yeah. What we want to know what's the difference between the supply and the delivery, yes. OK. So the supplier, well, the delivery part is PPO. PPL is the delivery company, so we'll always be the delivery that's PPO. And then the supplier is whoever you choose. And if you don't choose a supplier then you stay with PPL as the supplier. So right now you have residence energy. Yeah, we're true residents energy because. They said that we're going to be some lower in our bill, but we don't see any difference. So why we didn't stay with PPL? So. Right now they are charging you 0.****. PPO's rate is 1.10 point ****, so they're just slightly lower than PPO, not very much at all. Well, not very much. To really see some savings, you need to get something a little lower than 0.14. What were you thinking? We have a program.

There is a billing situation going on right now that we are aware of. It is being corrected. It will be corrected by your next bill. So you could make a payment.

So we can currently OK estimate or build that we know uses for and just pay instead of paying this ****something like that, is that what you're saying, right? Correct. And then when the bill is corrected with the next bill, if you do end up overpaying? Then you're gonna get it back as a credit. Oh. So we are going to read the meter, it's going to get red. You're going to get the real usage. With the next bill. Yeah, you just, you just brought my pressure down, alright, so we will.

After one year customers will receive their power supply delivered at a discounted price compared to the real cost of electricity delivered by a more expensive or ""participating"" supplier. The difference between the two options is that the participating supplier will provide you with one year of free electricity. There are two options you can opt for the default service option or choose a non-participating energy supplier during the first year. During the second year the price may fluctuate depending on market conditions. To avoid receiving a bill comparing prices constantly you will only receive one bill per year. Once the one-year grace period ends you can exit the program or select a different provider during the following year. In either case there will be no penalty for leaving the program. Customers will also have the option of choosing from among several energy suppliers including tomorrow energy which had been very good the night before but does not participate todayEnergy is not participating Tomorrow energy is not taking part in the Standard Offer program.

']",Transfer of service,Interpreter services,"'The narrator explains that the reason he is calling is that he wants to transfer service from his mom\'s old house to her new one. He then asks if there is an existing account with the company and the man selling the burgers gives him the address of the salami factory where his mother is thinking of starting a new service. The man tells him that because his mother does not speak any English she will need someone to translate into Spanish for her since she is planning to open a new customer service in her new house. Before the account can be transferred however the man needs to speak to his mother who speaks no English. After the man gives the instructions and the woman agrees to have an interpreter interpreter they go on to discuss how the account will be transferred. The narrator then goes on to describe the process of transferring service from one house to another but stops when he sees the word ""dining"" in the name of the company. It is at this point that he learns that his mother has two children under her care. The whole transaction takes place in a room full of sturdily dressed servants.'"

Thank you Joseph, and you can tell me their phone number associated to this account. Time *********. ****So this account is a cash only account and this means you have two or more return payments in the last. 12 months. So you're going to be able to make the payments only with three options, right? You can make the payment on cash, you can send a mail, or you can make a money order. Uh, sorry to tell you this. No. This will be added to your account for 12 months. Now you want to review this, right? Yeah, I was wondering if that can be removed just because Umm, it was it was an error on my side, but Umm, my account number to my credit, my checking account and I just forgot to update it. Umm. And I have it all squared away now, but I was just hoping to be able to get that removed so that I can like actually pay electronically. Alright, well, I'm sorry, I don't know if we can remove this from this account at this moment. I want to transfer you to a billing department to verify that, OK? Wait, I'm sorry, can you say that again? Going to transfer you to a billing department tool by 5 if we can remove the cash only account and status you get. How how long is it going to be a cash account? This will be for 12 months. Umm, no, I know you from the moment I can speak to you that I can get that removed. And it's only $****I mean, it's not that much money. No, but I'm not going to be able to do it. I mean, I don't know if you can apply for this, but if you can, I'm not going to be able. To remove this because I know like I don't have the permission. I don't know if I explain myself right. Umm, can I have your permission? Yeah, no problem. But I mean for you want to remove or by fire, but this is status, right? So you have to speak to somebody in the billing department. For that reason you have to transfer your call. OK, that's fine. Alright. Umm. Hi Sir. Thank you for calling Joseph for saying the line going around for your call. OK. What is going on? Hi, thank you for calling PPL. My name is Amanda and who I have the pleasure of speaking with today. Hey, uh, my name is Joseph Krahn. OK, Mr. crown. And the address and phone number you're calling about today? ****Bernie Ave. Scranton, PA **** and phone number ************. OK. And how can I assist you today? Um, I had two payments that were returned to me. I had my old checking account number, it's switched and I didn't realize that I didn't update it. Umm. On the website saved Umm so. Uh, now I am on a cash only one. I was wondering if that could be removed. I mean, like it's only $100 I can pay for it. Like right now over the phone. Umm, I just didn't want to be on cash only. Uh, yeah. Umm. So it's not something that we're going to be able to remove, unfortunately. Umm, if I could, I would. And it's, and it's not just me, it's like we're not going to be able to because of the return status. So it's going to be, I believe it's on the 22nd of December of this year, ****that it will be removed because it's on for like a year. So I know it can be very inconvenient. Umm. There are ways to pay so you don't go to the store, like, Umm, Western Union. Umm, I know that some people don't want to use that, but that is an option so you don't have to go into the stores to use the Western Union app. Umm, but unfortunately, like I said, that's the only other way to really get around having to go into the store. Until there. I can do uh, like. There could be an issue like I can pay through like my Wells Fargo app or something too, right? Umm, I don't believe you can pay it that way when you're on the cash only. But Umm, I can double check. I think it has to be if you're going to your bank, it has to be by certified check. Yeah, I don't. So that's not gonna work. OK. Yeah. Umm. OK, bear with me one moment. Alright, thank you. OK. Yeah, so the only way is to make the payments at this time would be certified checks Western Union app. I'm sorry, Western Union up or what? I'm sorry, are you still? I think you yourself. I'm sorry. I didn't hear anything. I'm sorry, I I it's OK. Sorry I lost you for a minute. I apologize. Umm, so, yeah, I don't know what you heard, but the Western Union app certified checks or an authorized payment center are the only way that you're able to pay right now. OK, Umm, can you give me information about the Western Union app? Like do I have to have a bank account with them or something? I. I don't think you have to have a bank account with them. Umm, I don't know. I don't use it personally, so I don't know what it really looks like when you navigate it, but I. It did download it a long time ago. I can kind of see what it was like for when you sign in and I. I know that you put in you know, who you're trying to make a payment to and things like that, and it goes through a couple different prompts and then ask like the amount and everything. I don't know if there's any like service charges for it. Umm, you'd have to look on there when you go on and see what it tells you. But I would just download it and see if that's something you want to use. Excuse me? OK. Hey, Umm, Ian. There is literally, like if I call in and speak to a supervisor or anything. There's literally no way that anyone will release this from me, even though it's literally $****Yeah, I know. And I I get it. It can be. A little. Umm. Restricting, I guess is the best way to put it, but I, you know, I apologize. But yeah, they're going to tell you the same thing. They're not going to be able to remove it given the situation, so. Those stupid Umm. If we could, I definitely would, you know, I mean like as a one time courtesy I would definitely do that for you. But because I get it, it was just a lapse in like you know, remembering basically rules on file and everything but. It's just yeah. OK, yeah, and one time courtesy. Uh, I used to. Umm. And that's not a possibility at all. A1 time courtesy. I mean, I can double check, I can I can double check to see if that's something that somebody will allow, but. I'm going. You know having this type of situation and then. Yeah, it's been in no most cases, but I will for you double check to see if that's something somebody will allow me to do. Just OK. And you? Kill them with anything. So I just want to make sure that you know, like you know. OK. No. OK, give me one second. I will double check for you. Thank you. OK. Thank you for your patience. I appreciate it. So yeah, I did double check and. We're not going to be able to. OK. Thank you for trying. I appreciate it. Umm. I mean, I guess UH-11 last one, last tactic I, I've been getting uh letters about switching to a different electric company for like eco friendly. Umm, would you guys take that into account if I say I'm just going to switch my service because I probably will now at this point. Well, so when you switch your service, you're only switching your generation, Umm and transmission portion of your bill. You're still going to have PPL. So it's not going to even changing that. It's not going to change who you actually get billed through. You're still billed through us. You just have a different electric supplier at a different rate. So if you find so basically saying you can shop around for cheaper rates this way you're saving a little bit of money, Umm, so like say because we're 14.612 right now, right. So say you go with clear Sky and there are 10. Sense you're just saving money in that aspect, but you're still we're your distributor because you're in PPL service area. So you can't change to like met Ed because they don't have Umm, I guess jurisdiction you would say over your where you're pulled and your lines are. Ohh OK never mind. It was worth a try though. Alright. Umm hey well thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Umm, yeah. I hope you have the next day. OK. All right. Well, you as well and I just want to you know we went over today the cash only and you know unfortunately like I said, I do apologize that we can't do it. It does seem, I know you said it was stupid and I understand you know the frustration with it and I do apologize again, Umm, but we discussed how it's going to be on there until ****of ****That's when it will be lifted. We went over, you know, the options of how you can pay with the certified check, the Western Union or the authorized Bill Payment Center. If you ever at any point also need any authorized bill payment centers, you can always call in and. Ask and double check which ones are so we'll see the automatic notation from them that you made the payment. Umm. But I just want to make sure that in the meantime that has satisfied your concerns. Yeah. Alright, you're welcome. And at PPL utilities, it's kind of about what we were talking about the different Umm generation suppliers. We have a program called the standard offer program and through the program you might be able to save some money by enrolling with an electric generation supplier. Are you interested in doing that or and want more information because if you would like more information on that program, I can transfer you, but if not, then that's fine too. No, I'm good. Thank you. All right. Mr. Cromwell, you have a good rest of your day. I hope you had a happy New Year and I apologize that we couldn't get more resolved for you today and in a better way, but.

34,CA7f3eed40986d695f08e27f230bbf1bc8,"Hello, thank you for calling PPL. My name is Daniel. How can I assist you today? Hi. Yes, I was calling Umm. I noticed a different kind of charge on my bill, so I I'm sure you've heard a lot about this lately. Umm, I just wanted to confirm and ask you what that charge was for? OK, let me take a look at your account to check about that charge. OK, so let's start with your name. Can I have your first and last name please? Uh sure, my name is Brooke BROKE. Last name Livering Liv as in Victor ERING. OK. Brooke, can you also provide me with your address, please? Uh sure. It should be Umm ****Mill Rd. unit B Umm. It's either in Grantham or Mechanicsburg. Umm Grantham ZIP code is **** and Mechanicsburg is ****. OK. OK, we'll take a look at the account on the Grand Thumb first. OK. So, Brooke, can you also provide me with your phone number, please? Uh sure area code 717 uh *******. OK. Thank you very much for that information. I pull in the account for you. Just give me one second. Sure. OK. Broke I have the account that you have on Brandon. OK, so you're stating that you haven't. Extra charge on your bill, is that correct? Yeah, the Umm, on this month cycle Bill, I noticed a distribution charge of ****Umm, that's a new charge. I have never seen that before on my bill, so I was wondering if you can give me answers to why that is. So just send it delivery of ****correct? That's correct. OK. OK. Actually, Umm, what is what is happening? OK is that all your bills normally have a delivery and supply charges, OK, that's according to to the usage on the account. OK. Normally if you send your your Donald, OK, your blue donut. You will see that the the dark blue is delivery OK charge on your account. Umm doesn't matter how much you use on your account, normally that delivery OK that blue. The dark blue part is always on the same side, so OK, so that means the delivery is according to the usage on their account. So that means if the delivery went up, that's because your usage went up as well. If you take a comparison on your last B, locate the last bill that we sent you in November, your usage was 748 kilowatts per hour after per hour. Yeah, your total Bill was $140.35. That means we charge you for delivery for 786 and we charge you for supply $92.00. $0.49 what happened on this bill OK for December is that your research went for 700 OK to ****kilowatts per hour. That means your usage went up to $173.86 and the delivery would charge you ****just to keep the same amount, the same percentage of your delivery. So if you take both bills OK and you compare. One to each other, you will see that blue donut OK, the dark blue dark and the light blue colors. It will stay on the same size because the delivery is according to your usage. And is this delivery, is this a new charge you guys, Umm have been distributing? I mean how long will I get a delivery charge, every bill from now on from you guys for that delivery charge, is that a new charge that you guys went ahead and just added or? Ohh, no, no, no. Let me explain to you how this works. OK. Umm just to clarify something, PPL, OK, the delivery is coming from PPL, OK, because we are the delivery company, OK. But the supply charges is a different charge that is coming from a different company. What PPL do, OK, is that we buy the supply on the market and then we sell it back to you at the same price we buy it. OK. So you will see non supply, there is an amount, OK, a rate of. Zero point ****, I don't know if you could see in the Avenger bill, that's the amount that we charge for supply because as the same amount we buy it on the market. So that means PPL just get a profit from delivery. The delivery is on according amount, OK with the public utility Commission. So it's not PPL who set the amount for delivery or for supply, OK, that is set by the state and that amount is used to for the profit of PPL and also to maintain the delivery of. The electricity such the polls the wires on all the service we need to bring electricity to you. So that delivery is we have it from the whole time PPL have been working on Pennsylvania. OK. And that you are saying then due to that that will continue Umm through you guys, is that that delivery, is that correct? Yes, yes, it will continue throughout. Actually, Umm, there is just two companies, some PS that are working on delivering electricity. All the other companies are just supply. So right now as I said, that's an amount that is set by the public Utility Commission. So it's regulated. It's not like PPL choose, that amount is chosen by the public Utility Commission as a fair price according to the maintenance of the equipment and also for the profit of PPL. OK. OK. Umm. I guess then that is all I need an explanation for. Umm. Like I said, I found it kind of new that it would just add it on there without no notice or nothing like that. But that's alright I guess. Umm, I guess that's all I have for you then. I appreciate you taking the time to explain that. Ohh, not a problem but not a problem. Actually that's a very common question and you have a good point because at this time you're seeing that amount high. But if there was more related than on your usage, OK, you have more usage so the delivery went up as well. But what I would recommend you. I will just wanted to let you know OK that on winter it's normal to have higher bills especially because I seen here that your house is electric heated home. OK. So if you want what I could assist you with is if you want to go on the website pplelectric.com you will send a choose a site saying like energy education that they could give you tips on how to save energy or if you want I could transfer you with them on the phone and they could give you tips of what is called. Happening on your house because I seen that you have a big usage increase on your account and it could also help you to fix that if you want to. Uh, OK. No, not at this time. Umm, if I if I want to, I can go ahead and get a hold of you guys or go through the website. But thank you so much for all that. I appreciate. It OK, not a problem broke. OK. And that in that set I have all your concerns being satisfied? Yes, yes. Yep. OK. And before I let you go broke, Umm, I want to give you one information as it's regarding this supply. OK. Umm, remember I told you that the supply is PPL buying into the market and then selling back to the customer and the same price we we buy it, OK, that's because at PPL, electric utilities or job is to deliver power safely and reliably to your home or business, but we don't own the power plants with that electricity is generated. Pennsylvania, you can choose that the supplier that provides your electricity without impacting the quality of service we provide. We have a program called the standard offer program. Through the program, you may be able to save some money by enrolling with electric generation supplier. Would you like to have more? Nope. That is, Nope. I'm good to go. OK, not a problem, bro. I just want to let you know that that information is available on the website as well in case you want to take a look about that standard offer program and save some money. OK?
